## Assignment 1 - Student Card Application

The purpose of this assignment is to create a "student card" application built in Java using the JavaFX library and the MVC design pattern. 

When the application launches, the GUI opens with default student informtion displayed. After selecting the new student button, users can enter the information of another student which will then be displayed instead. Another screen is available that allows the user to add the student's favourite activites, which will then be displayed as a list.
